# Northcoders News API

If you would like to clone and run this repo locally, please make sure that you set up two .env files in order to access the databases correctly. 

Firstly, you will need to create .env.development which should contain PGDATABASE=nc_news

Secondly, you will need to create .env.test which should contain PGDATABSEnc_news_test

You will then need to run the setup and seed scripts. After that, you should be able to access all the endpoints freely.
